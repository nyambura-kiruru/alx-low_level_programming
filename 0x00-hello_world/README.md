In this repository we will work everything related to the C programming language Some of the basic commands that we will see will be:

gcc printf (3) puts putchar

C is a general-purpose programming language that offers syntactic economy, flow control, and simple structures and a good set of operators. It is not a very high-level language and rather a small, simple language and is not specialized in any type of application. This makes it a powerful language, with an unlimited scope and above all, it is learned quickly. In no time, a programmer can use the entire language.

This language has been closely linked to the UNIX operating system, since they were jointly developed. However, this language is not linked to any operating system or to any specific machine. It is usually called a system programming language due to its usefulness for writing compilers and operating systems, although any type of application can also be developed.
